    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>I decided to pick something that I personally am very fond of. I work as a personal trainer and love to help people lead healthier lives. In my theme I will briefly go over some of the goals I set for clients. Also, I will show when exercise regimens need to be changed.</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code 
story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is 
thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with 
that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this 
template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
